// Controllers - REMEMBER `module.exports` at the bottom of each file! Also ensure you are requiring the correct modules/files at the top of each controller!
//
// 	3 controllers: statics, restaurants and authentications.
//
// 	- authentications.js
//     	- this will have two functions:
//      	 	- authenticationsLogin (exported as login)
//       		- authenticationsRegister (exported as register)
// 	- then restaurants.js
//     	- here there will be just one function defined: restaurantsIndex (exported as index)
// 	- then statics.js
//   		- here there is one function defined which loads up the index.html. This is executed as soon as the page initially loads (i.e. a GET request to the home url (e.g. http://localhost:3000))
// 	- Given that in these controllers, I am referring to the User model (for login and reigster) and the Restaurant model, I would now look to build out these models files.
